* Handy way to read Russian channels about OSINT/cybersecurity:

 ``` (an alternative to built-in translation in Telegram)



There are many Russian-language Telegram channels that publish a huge amount of up-to-date information on OSINT (and cybersecurity in general). 

There are many ways to read them without knowing the language. Today I will show you one of them, which I found quite handy:


1. Copy the name of the channel (from the description) to the clipboard.

2. Add some text to it to make a link:


https://t-me.translate.goog/s/

+channel name +

?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en

3. Open this link in browser


Examples:

OSINT Club  https://t-me.translate.goog/s/osint_club_channel?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en)
Social Engineering  https://t-me.translate.goog/s/Social_engineering?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl



OSINT Mindset  https://t-me.translate.goog/s/osint_mindset?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl
Russian OSINT  https://t-me.translate.goog/s/Russian_OSINT?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl



Internet Rozysk https://t-me.translate.goog/s/irozysk?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl
Investigation&Forensic Tools https://t-me.translate.goog/s/forensictools?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl


------------------

Naturally, this method works for Telegram channels in all other languages that Google Translator supports.

If you want to translate an individual message, you can also use translation bots:


@odbots
@SimpTransBot
@lingvanexbot
@YTranslateBot
@translationchatbot (translate all messages in chats)


(and once again, a reminder about  built-in translation in Telegram)
